# Solo

SOLO is a roommate matching application for students who attend UNC Charlotte. Our goal is to give new students the opportunity to view, match, and communicate with other students who want to live in similar on-campus housing locations. Students will also be allowed to add users to groups and communicate with each in order to effectively build the best college dorm living experience.
