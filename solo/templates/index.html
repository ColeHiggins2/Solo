              (The city of Charlotte had sought a public university since 1871 but was never able to sustain one. For years, the nearest
              state-supported university was 90 miles (140 km) away. The city submitted a bid in the late 1880s for what would become North
               Carolina State University, but lost to the city of Raleigh after a local farmer offered to donate land for the campus.
                In 1946, the city sought a state-run medical school; instead, the state expanded the existing two-year school at UNC-Chapel Hill.)

            <p class="p3Team">
              We are all UNCC students of the 2019 class. We decicded to create SOLO as an idea for our software development
              project. We experienced the process of rooming and had some unfortunate roomates ourselves. So it became our
              objective to help others with this struggle by making their experience easier and more enjoyable than what
              we had to deal with. We hope this website brings all of you closer to finding the perfect roommate!
